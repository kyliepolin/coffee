    Francine has always dreamed of opening up a resturant since she was a little girl. She was always so facinated of the many ways her dad prepared his coffee in the morning. Francine loved the endless things you can add coffee to make  all different kinds of flavors. It was at age 15 that she knew she wanted to open her own café. Francine quickly went to work to brainstorm a name and a slogan. She suddenly came up with the name when her dad one day replied with "cool beans!" after Francine expressed her passion to open up a café. After hearing the cheesy phrase, it was as if a lightbulb went off. She knew that "cool beans" had to be the name of the café. Francine's dreams became a reality in 2015 when she was able to open her own café.
    
    
    <p> "It's surreal" Francine says. "My dad was my biggest supporter when making my crazy dream a reality. I couldn't have done it without him! I get to walk in my café everyday knowing that my dad helped me through the whole journey."

    <h2> About the staff</h2>
    <p>
    
    Francine loves the art of coffee and made it her mission to find staff that shared the same interest. She met two people in her local café. She immediately noticed that they all share a passion towards coffee and she knew she wanted to start her buisness with them. Ever since then, Francine and her two friends have been reaching out find other people that love coffee as much as they do. All of the staff are highly trained to make any type of coffee in a fast and efficent manner. With 15 staff working full time at Cool Beans Cafe, Francine hopes to find other people that are a perfect fit for the café!
